# The XES system.

## It's a system ,  height performance , easy using , very safe , open source system.



# A SYSTEM

| Open Source        | Performance | Ease of use | Security | Size         |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------ |
| By GPLv3.0 license | Height      | Easy        | Very     | about Â½ 10GB |

## Why it is height performance?

### It using smart tasks admin program , Like this:

####  if CPU have ... cores.

| A core                       | Two or Four cores  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| All tasks are handled by it. | Split tasks evenly |

#### OR MORE THAN FOUR CPU CORES ?

just like this:

| A task             | Two tasks                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| For core 0 handled | Main T.1 to core 0 and 1 , T.2 to core 2 and 3. |

Repeat this.

#### How are the system and bottom layers handled?

| system core | Function                |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| XDW         | draw window             |
| XSF         | keep you security       |
| XPA         | performance admin tools |
| XOS         | admin others tasks      |

### And , Memory.

un... if now have a program in your memory , XES handles it this way:

swap some "Not used often files" to /swap partition , And usually used files at your memory.

the swap partition , You can customize its size.

## Where is its ease of use?

### User interface design.

#### We use this approach:

#### notify:

#### set up:

#### start:

#### control center:

#### Desktop widgets:

#### Application list:
