## Why it is height performance?

### It using smart tasks admin program , Like this:

####  if CPU have a cores.

| A core                       | Two or Four cores  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| All tasks are handled by it. | Split tasks evenly |

#### OR MORE THAN FOUR CPU CORES ?

just like this:

| A task             | Two tasks of more                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| For core 0 handled | Main T.1 to core 0 and 1 , T.2 to core 2 and 3. |

Repeat this.

#### How are the system and bottom layers handled?

| system core | Function                |

the swap partition , You can customize its size.
